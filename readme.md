Welcome to my Pull Request practice log.

This is the branch.

 I don't know how many people will check out the history and notice the differences I made on these small practice logs. 

I have Bachelor of Music, Master of Music and Artist Certificate in Cello Performance but I'm now learning IT, gits, linux, and python.

My next goal after learning python is to study pytest automation, selenium....I'm not sure if I spelled it correctly, SQL, and Jira....

I hope I can achieve my goals.

Thank you for reading my practice log.
